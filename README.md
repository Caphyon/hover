# hover
[Hover](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/hover) is a free tool that allows you to run natively installed applications inside an MSIX or App-V container.

There comes a time when you need to **debug** your [virtual applications](http://www.advancedinstaller.com/msix). 
We all use PowerShell, but it is unproductive to repeat long commands, so we built a tool that saves your time when troubleshooting your MSIX or App-V applications.

---

All you have to do is to launch App-V Context Launcher from the shortcut created by the [installer package](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/tools/Hover.msi), then from the GUI select on the right the virtual application target package and from the right side pane double click the program you want to launch in the container context. 
You can also add new programs to that list, we've just included a predefined list for the most used.
